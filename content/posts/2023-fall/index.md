### Oct 6, 2023

Got home from a 2-week vacation and the tomatoes are going strong but overrun the garden. Peppers are good - banana/yellow peppers are mostly unchanged, but bell peppers are small and turned to red which is awesome.

- Harvested cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, carrots, and radishes.

- Carrots: I only picked the carrots that were clearly shouldering, and they're about 4-5 inches.

- Radishes: I pulled all the radishes and only a few had bulbed. There was no difference in what grew a radish root based on the tops, so I'm wondering if there was a nutrient difficiency or if the soil was too compacted. I need to research this before trying again in the spring. The radishes in the raised bed also didn't grow, and did worse than the grow bag.

  - Maybe too dense soil?

  - Maybe too much nitrogen in soil?

  - Maybe too warm during beginning of germination/grow time.

- I pulled all tomato plants because we're basically done for the year and I either needed to pull them or severely prune them. There was still a lot of green unripe tomatoes, so I bet if I have a better pruning strategy next year they'll last longer.

- Leaving the peppers for another week or two to decide what to do with the yellow peppers.

- I need to acidify the blueberry containers some more.

- Got materials to set up a frost fabric cover over the raised bed to try to grow lettuce for another few weeks.

### Oct 7, 2023

- Installed PVC pipes as hoops on the raised bed. The frost cover comes tomorrow, so that's when I'll add that in. Seeded lettuce and bok choy on either end of the bed.

- Ripped out plants on front porch: all mint, parsley, lettuce, and chives (all dead). Mint had a pretty insane root system in the pots that spiraled around a lot. All containers need more potting soil + compost in the spring.
