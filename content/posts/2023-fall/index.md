### Oct 6, 2023

Got home from a 2-week vacation and the tomatoes are going strong but overrun the garden. Peppers are good - banana/yellow peppers are mostly unchanged, but bell peppers are small and turned to red which is awesome.

- Harvested cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, carrots, and radishes.

- Carrots: I only picked the carrots that were clearly shouldering, and they're about 4-5 inches.

- Radishes: I pulled all the radishes and only a few had bulbed. There was no difference in what grew a radish root based on the tops, so I'm wondering if there was a nutrient difficiency or if the soil was too compacted. I need to research this before trying again in the spring. The radishes in the raised bed also didn't grow, and did worse than the grow bag.

  - Maybe too dense soil?

  - Maybe too much nitrogen in soil?

  - Maybe too warm during beginning of germination/grow time.

- I pulled all tomato plants because we're basically done for the year and I either needed to pull them or severely prune them. There was still a lot of green unripe tomatoes, so I bet if I have a better pruning strategy next year they'll last longer.

- Leaving the peppers for another week or two to decide what to do with the yellow peppers.

- I need to acidify the blueberry containers some more.

- Got materials to set up a frost fabric cover over the raised bed to try to grow lettuce for another few weeks.
