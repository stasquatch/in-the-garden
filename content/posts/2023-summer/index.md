## Turnover and plans

The last broccoli harvest occurred on June 29th, 2023 and I had to tediously pick out easily a dozen caterpillars from each head. It didn't seem like the caterpillars appeared until very recently, so I'm not sure if this is a sign of a late harvest or that I should use netting next year to avoid these bugs.

The cabbage started to stall, probably because it was competing for resources with the tomatoes. As I was removing them, I noticed there were wasps coming in and eating bug eggs/larvae, which was cool to watch. It's nice to know there's a bit of an ecosystem existing in my garden. I removed the cabbage in an effort to prevent those eggs from hatching and spreading to other plants, as well as avoid any harm to the tomato plants which I would prefer to thrive over the cabbage.

The tomatoes have been challenging to keep pruned with the support options I have available to me, so I think next year I'll plan on focusing on broccoli and lettuce next year with netting to keep bugs off of them.

### June 29, 2023

* Harvested last of broccoli and pulled out the plants

* Started sunflowers by the garage and in the front garden

### July 7, 2023

* Removed cabbage

* I have new seeds coming soon and plan on planting fava bean cover crop where the broccoli and cabbage was to fix more nitrogen in the soil again. I'll also grow buckwheat after the fava beans to further enrich the soil and prep them for heavy-feeders in the spring (broccoli).

* Roses are looking awesome, and we found a volunteer hibiscus plant in another bed, so I think I'll start flowering perennial bushes by the garage for next year.
